    <h2>Towers of Hanoi:</h2>
    <div>

            The goal of the towers of hanoi is to move the stack of rings starting on peg 1
            and move them to peg 3. However, only the top ring of a stack can be moved, and
            no ring may ever be placed on top of a smaller ring.

    <h2>Light Up (aka Caves / Akari):</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            The goal of a Light Up puzzle is to light up every cell in the grid, aside 
            from the walls. This can be done by placing lights in the grid, but no light
            is allowed to light up any other light. Walls stop light from passing through
            them. Some walls also have an allotted number of lights that 
            <textbf>must</textbf> be orthogonally adjacent to that wall.
            <br><br>
            By entering a number on the opening screen, you will be taken to a grid of that
            size. Here you can build your own puzzle. You can modify cells by simply pressing 
            buttons to edit the cell your mouse is over. "Space" will add a wall, and the numbers
            0 - 4 will add a wall with that clue. "Delete" will make the cell blank. Left clicking
            the mouse will increment the value of the clue, or go from 4 to empty.
            <br><br>
            When the puzzle is ready, click "Enter" to start solving. If you selected a random
            puzzle, you will be taken directly to the solving state. To submit a solution, 
            press the enter key. If the solution is correct, it will be made clear.
