            <h2>Boids Simulation:</h2>
            <p>
                Boids is an artificial life simulation, originally developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986.
                It simulates the flocking behavior of birds. In this simulation, each "boid" follows a set of rules:
                separation, alignment, and cohesion. Separation means that each boid tries to avoid its neighbors.
                Alignment means that each boid tries to match its velocity with its neighbors. Cohesion means that each
                boid tries to move towards the center of the group.
                <br><br>
                To interact with the simulation, you can use the sliders to adjust the size of the boids, the maximum
                force they can apply, the maximum speed they can reach, the desired separation between them, and the
                distance at which they consider other boids to be neighbors. You can also click on the screen to add
                new boids. The "Remove Some Boids" button will remove 10% of the current boids. The "Show Clouds"
                checkbox will toggle the display of clouds in the background.

            <h2>Space Shooting Game</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of Untitled Space Game is to survive as long as you can while destroying
                meteors and alien ships for bonus points. This is an arcade / roguelike style game, where each
                run has no impact on the previous one.
                <br><br>
                To control the ship, use the left and right arrow keys to rotate. Press space bar to shoot your 
                laser beam.

            <h2>Towers of Hanoi:</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of the towers of hanoi is to move the stack of rings starting on peg 1
                and move them to peg 3. However, only the top ring of a stack can be moved, and
                no ring may ever be placed on top of a smaller ring.

            <h2>Light Up (aka Caves / Akari):</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of a Light Up puzzle is to light up every cell in the grid, aside 
                from the walls. This can be done by placing lights in the grid, but no light
                is allowed to light up any other light. Walls stop light from passing through
                them. Some walls also have an allotted number of lights that 
                <strong>must</strong> be orthogonally adjacent to that wall.
                <br><br>
                By entering a number on the opening screen, you will be taken to a grid of that
                size. Here you can build your own puzzle. You can modify cells by simply pressing 
                buttons to edit the cell your mouse is over. "Space" will add a wall, and the numbers
                0 - 4 will add a wall with that clue. "Delete" will make the cell blank. Left clicking
                the mouse will increment the value of the clue, or go from 4 to empty.
                <br><br>
                When the puzzle is ready, click "Enter" to start solving. If you selected a random
                puzzle, you will be taken directly to the solving state. To submit a solution, 
                press the enter key. If the solution is correct, it will be made clear.
